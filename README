DESCRIPTION
    The DCE RPC protocol is an application level protocol from OpenGroup
    that allows applications to do Remote Procedure Calls. It is the
    underlying wire protocol for DCOM (Distributed Common Object Model) by
    Microsoft.

    This module was motivated by an reverse-engineering effort on a DCOM
    client. Therefore, functions that are implemented gear more toward
    client side implementation. Also, the initial version only supports
    Connection Oriented version of DCE RPC. It also assumes NTLMSSP as the
    underlying authentication protocol. This can change based on the input
    of the users of this modules.

DEPENDENCIES
    In general, it depends on the authentication module. Since we only
    support NTLM, you have to install it first to use it. Currently, it
    requires Authen-Perl-NTLM-0.10.

ASSUMPTIONS
    1) The version of DCE RPC Connection Oriented protocol supported is 5.0.

    2) NTLM is the only supported authentication scheme.

    3) AUTH_LEVEL_CONNECT is the authentication level of choice.

    4) Network Data Representation (NDR) is assumed to be ASCII for
    characters, little endian for integers and IEEE for floating points.

    5) Call Id is always zero. It seems to me my client works regardless of
    the value of call id.

TO-DO
    1) Support fragmented CO Requests.

    2) Implement Connection Oriented server side functions.

    3) Implement Connection-less functions.

    4) Implement the module in C.

BUGS
    Nothing known.
